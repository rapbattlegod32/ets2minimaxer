# Information
This is a tiny project I wanted to do, this allows you to store all your ets2 recent jobs to see if you can get the minimaxer achievement which is to gain 20,000XP within 10,000KM (2XP per 1KM).

# How to use
If you haven't got node install it here: https://nodejs.org/en.

Edit the contents of the 'jobs.json' file in the directory.
Example: 
![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapbattlegod32/ets2minimaxer/main/media/examplepic.png)

Write down the distance(KM) and experience(XP) gained from the delivery and make a duplicate line with a comma at the end() and edit those values.

<!-- Lil something I wanted to make to make my job tracking a bit easier for the 'minimaxer',
gain 20,000xp under 10,000km. This essentially means completing jobs that give you over
2xp for each km done, personally so far I have been doing urgent delivery + fragile + 
adr and jobs over 250km with the 90xp parking option. -->
